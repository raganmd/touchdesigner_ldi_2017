# TouchDesigner Training | LDI 2017

## Overview
Join Matthew Ragan from Obscura Digital for a whirlwind tour of developing custom playback and generative systems. Over the course of two full days participants will learn the fundamental principles and organizational flow of working in Derivative’s TouchDesigner – for the uninitiated, TouchDesigner is a node based programming environment used in installations, live events, and museums internationally. This workshop will largely be focused on the intersection of art / design and the development of new tools for live performance. While there are a growing number of tools for media playback in live events, there are precious few for creating dynamic and generative artwork. In this workshop we will look at both how to playback traditionally made content, as well as how to build generative real-time rendered environments. Participants will also look at using existing modules in TouchDesigner for projection mapping applications large and small. More than just a flash and trash demo, this workshop aims to help familiarize participants with a development environment as well as examine the challenges and opportunities when designing real-time systems.

Participants can expect to walk away from the workshop with:

* an understanding the development environment
* best practices for development and organization
* foundational principles for playing and cueing traditional media
* foundational principles and experience creating generative artwork
* an overview of techniques for building user interfaces for interactive systems
* experience projection mapping with TouchDesigner
* an introduction to Python as a scripting language

## Target Audience

If turn key tools are out of your price range or lack the flexibility and adaptability you need for your media projects this might be the workshop for you. If you are an artist/designer/engineer that's looking for ways to engage with clients in ways that are outside of the bounds of traditional playback systems this might be the workshop for you. If you've been experimenting with TouchDesigner but want some direction in how to think about incorporating it into your larger workflow or project deployment, this might be the workshop for you. This workshop is built around beginner and intermediate concepts in working with TouchDesigner in installation / performance settings - no prior experience with TouchDesigner or Python is expected from participants.

## Getting Ready

As we speed towards LDI I hope you’re finding yourself excited about taking some time to learn more about TouchDesigner! Before you arrive, however, there are a few important things to keep in mind that will make the workshop run smoothly, and ensure you can focus on getting the most out of our time together. Below you’ll find a list of required first steps / tools to bring with you, and some recommended steps to help you prepare.

**Required**

* **Bring you Laptop** – Mac or PC. Make sure you review the [System Requirements](http://derivative.ca/wiki099/index.php?title=System_Requirements) from Derivative so you know you have a machine that’s TouchDesigner ready.

* **Don’t forget your power adapter** – TouchDesigner is largely a GPU based environment. This makes for fast operations, but often means that your battery will get consumed quickly. You’ll definitely want your adapter, even if it’s a pain to lug around.

* **[Download TouchDesigner 099](https://www.derivative.ca/099/Downloads/)** – it’s very important to make sure your machine can run TouchDesigner before you get to the workshop. There are some specific graphics card requirements and making sure everything works before the first day will make sure we can get the group started right away.

* **Get your TouchDesigner 099 License** – you can [register for a Derivative account here](http://www.derivative.ca/Login/RegisterForm.asp), and that will make sure you can create a non-commercial license key. The non-commercial license is free, and we won’t need anything more than this for our workshop.

**Recommended**

* **A 3 Button mouse** – You certainly can use a track pad while you’re working, but you’ll be much happier to have an actual mouse for working in Touch.

* **Download and Install a text Editor** – I like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but if you’re looking for free tools it’s hard to go wrong with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[**Join the TouchDesigner Slack Channel**](https://slackpass.io/touchdesigner) – there are lots of great folks to chat with and learn from in here.

* **Bring some Assets** – You certainly don’t have to bring any extra assets, but it’s often nice to have more than just the stock images / videos handy.

* **Business Cards** – the best resources you’ll find at LDI workshops will be the other people in the room with you. If  you’ve got some extra business cards make sure you bring a stack to share with the folks in our group.

* [**First Things To Know**](https://www.derivative.ca/wiki099/index.php?title=First_Things_to_Know_about_TouchDesigner) – We’re going to cover a good chunk of what you’ll find in these videos and transcripts, but when it comes to learning something new repetition is no bad thing. If you’ve got some time to kill on the plane or in your hotel room you might browse the wiki a little to get yourself familiar with the TouchDesigner environment.

**Be Inspired**

* Take a look at some of the projects featured on the [Derivative Blog](https://www.derivative.ca/Blog/) to see what people are making and doing with TouchDesigner.
